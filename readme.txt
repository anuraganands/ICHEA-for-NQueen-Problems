Australasian Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence, AI 2012: Advances in Artificial Intelligence. 

How to run:
1 - The program is old and relies on Swing Framework. Its GUI has been distorted a bit. You will need to add appframework-1.0.3.jar and swing-worker.jar into your project. Both jar files are available in the main folder. You may also need matlabcontrol-4.0.0.jar file.
2 - Run The program and wait for GUI screen to apprear. Select the following options in the given order:
- Nominal/Categorical or Ordinal Data
- Click Fill Test. You may change population size and total generations. 
- Click Get Data
- Select NQueen.dat
- Now enter the size of Nqueen you want to solve in the input box.
- Wait for the solution to appear in the NetBean's console output screen.
- Some other options may not work.
